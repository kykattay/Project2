          MISO was founded by Kylie Taylor, Deon Tutt, and Abbey Parchman. Based in Nashville, they wanted to bring something different to the city. All having a love for tradiational Japanese sushi and foods, they decided to open their very own sushi restaurant. Now, where does Miso Grill come from? 

They came up with the name Miso Grill over dinner one night, where they were scrolling through social media and a video popped up, ‘’Hm.. I really want some Miso soup,’’ the content creator had said, and a light bulb just clicked in their heads. 
‘’What about Miso Grill?’’
